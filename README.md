This is the assignment for module 4. 

This folder contains two subfolders and two files. 

The ipynb file contains the main code of the Jupyter Notebook. Please ensure that this file and the "Resources" folder are in the same directory when running the code, as the "Resources" folder contains two CSV data files. The other docx file is a summary report of the results obtained after running the code, including the conclusion section and two conclusions I derived. The "Images" folder contains the images provided in the original folder.
